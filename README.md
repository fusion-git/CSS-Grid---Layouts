# CSS Grid - Multiple layouts

This project run a simple index.html file with minimal assets like css or javascript. You can just open that file but I highly recommend you to setup a proper environment . <br /> <br /> 

In my case for this project I've used IDE [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with 'Live Server' extension.
